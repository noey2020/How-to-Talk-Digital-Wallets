We use to use pebbles and shells to barter. We discovered minerals, gold, and precious metals. We invented cash and currencies. We then innovated with credit cards. We introduced debit cards. We then went cashless. Notice, we always, we always and now, we introduce digital wallets. As an aside, debit cards overtook credit cards in popularity.
